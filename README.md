Dailyhopeless Landing Pages
=========================

I have attempted to create a website landing page template that I previously designed in Figma. I implemented the design using the Gatsby js framework and React js library. 
The design uses my favorite colors, black and yellow, and below are the mobile and desktop views. The mobile view is slightly different from the desktop view to fit the screen size.
